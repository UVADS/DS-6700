# DS6700

**Class Description** 

This course combines advanced topics in data ethics, critical data studies, public policy, governance, and regulation. We will learn to articulate ethical principles by addressing various types of challenges in Data Science and policy, divided according to relevant topics (Health, Education, Culture & Entertainment, Security & Defense, Cities, Environment, and Labor) and specific case studies. Next, we will research how data-centric systems are deployed within socioeconomic ecosystems and how they shape the world around us. Then we will interrogate the connections between data science, governments, industry, civil society organizations, and communities. Students will present their findings to their colleagues, write papers, and get familiarized with theoretical frameworks, legal and policy analysis, scientific knowledge production, and communicating research to specific audiences.
